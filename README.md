# Project Overview
We are developing website for a hotel reservation system. The general functionality of the system allows employees/the owner to manage the hotel and for customers to make bookings. The key features of the system are:
* Customers: make/cancel reservations with or without making an account; request additional ammentities for their reservation.
* Employees: view their shifts; view and update customers reservations and requests; flag repairs in the hotel.
* Owner: perform all the same actions as employees; set shifts and salaries for employees.
* Rooms: the hotel has suites, luxury, deluxe, and regular rooms; each room of a type has the same bed type, but potentially a different view.  

During the development process for this application, our team will follow the main software engineering activities: specification, development, validation, and evolution.
